<p>How long is an average in-home appointment? How should I prepare?</p></div>
<p>A white glove in-home appointment can last for 30 minutes to an hour, depending on how many items you have ready 
for our Luxury Manager to evaluate. As a courtesy, please buffer your appointment time by an extra 15 minutes. In preparation, <a href="#">look up similar items to your own and see prices of previously recently sold items.</a></p></div>

<p>Do any items qualify for a price approval request? If so, which ones and what is the process like?</p></div>
<p>Items valued at $995+ are elligible for a “Price Approval” before it goes on sale. Furs and exotic skins may also qualify. 
If you have pricing sensitivity around your goods, ask your Luxury Manager <a href="#">or our team </a>about this practice. Understand that the communication exchange about your item may take extra time and could delay its official launch to the site.</p></div>
